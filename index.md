**Timeline Earchive** is the premier archive for the *Timeline Earth* née *Friends Against Government* podcast (FAGcast), the news and entertainment show for anarchist, libertarian, and liberty-adjacent peoples such as Little Amal.

The podcast debuted on March 7, 2018, and was originally titled Friends Against Government, because FAG. It was rebranded after 183 episodes on December 9, 2020, as Timeline Earth, because the earth is an infinite expansion in two directions.

Basically, the official site sucks and the FAG episodes are hard to find, so here we are. Currently, this site only archives FAGcast episodes.

## Hosts

**Bird** ([@TLEbirdarchist](https://twitter.com/TLEbirdarchist)) is a lifelong Floridian, Neil Young boner hater, and the unofficial host. He enjoys long drives in the car, FOX Corporation, and editing Aaro**N**’s out of episodes.

**Car** ([@TLE_Car](https://twitter.com/TLE_Car)) is the sole proprietor of Carcadia, a semiprofessional volleyball player, and the only other host to come prepared for episodes. He enjoys Yuenglings, *assuming*, and anything which subverts the petrodollar.

**Aaro**N ([@PunishedBTWA](https://twitter.com/PunishedBTWA)) is the gainfully employed, regularly absent, and irreverant antihero of the show. He enjoys saying that which should not be said and is solely responsible if the Twitter handle linked here is out-of-date.

**Paz** ([@TLEPaz](https://twitter.com/TLEPaz)) is the kind-of host, sometimes guest, and definitely a spook. He enjoys cryptids, Warhammer 40K, and cryptids again.
